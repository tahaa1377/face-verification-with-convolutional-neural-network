# face-verification-with-convolutional-neural-network

This way, the person's picture is already available in the system and the new picture is compared with the face verification picture of the face verification system. If the system comes to the conclusion that these two pictures are of the same person, the system will give a positive answer, and if this is the case, the answer will be negative. (dissimilarity) will give.

Deep learning methods: Convolutional neural networks are used to learn on the training data, so that the network is used in the test phase of the answer.
